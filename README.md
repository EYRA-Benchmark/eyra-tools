EYRA Tools is a Python package that helps you generate Docker containers which
contain a submission or evaluation algorithm for the
[EYRA Benchmark platform](https://www.eyrabenchmark.net).

Benchmark participants should implement their algorithm in a submission
container, while benchmark organizers should implement an evaluation container
to evaluate the output generated by algorithms. The Docker containers
for submissions and evaluations are very similar and can be generated by typing:

```
eyra-generate [submission|evaluation] <container_name>
```

For more details on how to use this package, have a look at the
[documentation](https://eyra-tools.readthedocs.io/).
