EYRA Tools

EYRA Tools is a Python package that helps you generate Docker containers
containing a submission or evaluation for the
`EYRA Benchmark Platform <https://www.eyrabenchmark.net>`_.

Benchmark participants should implement a submission
container, while benchmark organizers should implement an evaluation container.
The Docker containers can be generated by typing:

.. code-block:: sh

    eyra-generate [submission|evaluation] <container_name> [-d <docker hub account>]
